        <h1>Virtual Youtuber</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        &emsp; Vtuber is an online entertainer who uses a virtual avatar
        generated using computer graphics.Real-time motion capture software or
        technology are often—but not always—used to capture movement. The
        digital trend originated in Japan in the mid-2010s, and has become an
        international online phenomenon in the early 2020s.[1] A majority of
        VTubers are English and Japanese-speaking YouTubers or live streamers
        who use avatar designs. By 2020, there were more than 10,000 active
        VTubers.[2] Although the term is an allusion to the video platform
        YouTube, they also use websites such as Niconico, Twitch, and Bilibili.
        The first entertainer to use the phrase "virtual YouTuber", Kizuna AI,
        began creating content on YouTube in late 2016. Her popularity sparked a
        VTuber trend in Japan, and spurred the establishment of specialized
        agencies to promote them, including major ones such as Hololive
        Production, Nijisanji and VShojo. Fan translations and foreign-language
        VTubers have marked a rise in the trend's international popularity.[3]
        Virtual YouTubers have appeared in domestic advertising campaigns, and
        have broken livestream-related world records. For this section i
        personally want to introduce one of the generation from Hololive called
        <a href="https://hololive.wiki/wiki/Hololive_Gamers">Hololive Gamers</a
